vscpd \- The VSCP Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
vscpd [\f[I]options\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The VSCP daemon is an open source daemon/server program that is part of
VSCP & Friends and is built and maintained by \[oA]ke Hedman, Grodans
Paradis AB (https://www.vscp.org).
The server act as a hub and collects information from different sources
and let clients collect this information over a TCP/IP, websocket, REST
interface etc and makes it easy to present or work on this date in real
time.
The daemon also has an internal scheduler that makes it possible to
control different scenarios such as simple tasks like to automatically
turn on a group of lamps at a specific time of the day or do complex
industrial control tasks.
.PP
On Unix systems the daemon is a standard server application that is
started in the background.
It is possible also to compile it to start as a standard application if
that way of running it is preferred.
.PP
The daemon uses simple to construct, yet very capable, drivers to talk
to the real world.
This means that a driver abstract real world things to look to the
system as any other VSCP enabled device even if it itself has no
knowledge what so ever about VSCP
